## WUSTL Biospecimen Navigator

The objective of the Biospecimen Navigator, developed at Washington University in St. Louis, (further WBN) is to facilitate the search and request for biospecimens stored at any Washington University Medical Center (WUMC) biorepository or laboratory, for basic and translational biomedical research projects.  The major goal of WBN is to serve as a high-level ‘warehouse’ of biospecimen inventory and annotation data that utilizes an investigator-centered and user-friendly web-based interface. WBN was developed in compliance with the best practices for software development and is modular and extensible so that future potential functionality (e.g. request tracking, billing, utilization reporting) can be easily added or integrated with other existing systems. The WBN project is a joint effort between the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) and the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at Washington University in St. Louis (WU).
